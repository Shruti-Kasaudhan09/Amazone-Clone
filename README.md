# Amazone-Clone

This is a front-end clone of the Amazon homepage built using only HTML and CSS. The project is designed to replicate the look and feel of Amazon's user interface, including the header, navigation bar, product sections, and footer. It focuses purely on layout and styling without any backend or JavaScript functionality.
